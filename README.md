My impressively small collection of Bookmarklets.

##how to use

- Click on the bookmarklets

##what's inside

###novalidate
Disable HTML5 validation of all forms on a page so the server side validation you created can be tested.

###src
Show the source code of the current page

###dev/prod
Switch the current page from the .dev version to the .be version et vice versa.
An exception is added for my personal home page [www.megasnort.com](http://www.megasnort.com) because it's a .com.
