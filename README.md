# Bookmarklets

My impressively small collection of Bookmarklets.

## how to use

- Import **bookmarklets.html** into your bookmarks
- Click on the bookmarklets

## what's inside

### filler
Fill in the active/first non-search form with sensible defaults. You might want to change the defaults to your own data.

### novalidate
Disable HTML5 validation of all forms on a page so the server side validation you created can be tested.

### src
Show the source code of the current page

### dev/prod
Switch the current page from the .dev version to the .be version et vice versa.
An exception is added for my personal home page [www.megasnort.com](http://www.megasnort.com) because it's a .com.

### google
Execute a Google Query of the selected text. If no text is selected, you get a prompt.

### maps
Execute a Google Maps query of the selected text. If no text is selected, you get a prompt.

### pdf
When you have a Google Presentation open, download the PDF-version **with** the notes (I use this for my teaching: one file to rule them all)
